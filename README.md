This project analyzes U.S. traffic accident data to identify patterns related to time, location, environment, and severity. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical testing, and an interactive dashboard.

Key insights highlight seasonal accident trends, regional concentration, urban vs rural differences, and the relationship between severity and injuries.

An interactive Tableau dashboard is included to allow users to explore the data using filters for month, region, and urban/rural classification.

 Tableau Public dashboard link is provided in the Jupyter Notebook.
 Full analysis and code are available in this GitHub repository
